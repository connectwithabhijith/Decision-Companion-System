Ai prompts:

i have been given a project to develop by a company which i got selected for by passsing a programing test. i want your help in solving it .

The whole question was copy pasted onto chatgpt

for a laptop the options which can be given are the ones you already mentiioned so in the case of performance and brand reliablity what can be the numerical values provided . should that be provided by the user or should be found? (chatgpt)

also how do we solve it for different scenarios? like choosing a laptop is different from choosing a candidate for a particular role which is different from choosing where to travel with particular constrants

i am confused about how do you take the input for different cases

how do i load the different criteria for each cases? i cannot predefine it right?

or should i get the criteria for each cases through an api call

after finding the sum how should i sort or choose them?

how will i get the cost effective laptop . should the weights be lower or greater be given

i think to get the lap with lowest price we should give min val to price weight because if all other values of critria are same for diff options then the lap with highest price will have the hgihest sum and the lowest weight will be cost effective right?

give me an outline of how the frontend should be designed?

i think i should use simple html css and javascript also it should be generic and takes in diff inputs for diff 

how does the type(cost or benefit) impact?

suppose if there are 4 criterion and price has cost performance has benefit and battery and company has also benefit how should the order of evaluating the final be like ?

yes now i understood it . what should i do first? from where should i begin..

give the logic code for the sample

so i should take the number of criteria and also number of inputs and then create inputs for the number of options with number of criteria ?

1. Read counts 2. Clear previous sections 3. Create criteria inputs 4. Create option inputs  
how to do this?

is name weight and type string?

hwo do you normally put string inside in an html file

is this actually taking all the values of the options

i have developed the project with html and javascript i would like to convert it to react

can you make it into different components?

same issue of tailwind suggestion in new project

how to increase thickness

also a beautiful button clssname

i wantsome gap some bw the 2 input and also the buttons

can i put an animated back ground image to this website

give better heading design no animation but a good font

hwo to bring this button center and also change the color

this criterion form is called all at once i want to call it such that one comes after enterring the details of the previous ones

each one of them should be aligned verrtically inside the box and all the boxes aligned horizontally across the page

so i ahve this idea .. instead of manually entering the criterias.. i should d insert an input tag and give the input like should i go for a trip and use an api call to get the criterias and appropriate weights for them and let automatically be filled and then if i need i can also change it from the display.

i choose using api call and also if it fails users have the option to enter the criteria manually

also now there is no input box for the user to enter their scenario i also want to add that the input may be like "should i go for a trip" or which laptp should i choose and frm them the ai should automatically choose the criterias and appropriate weight and type

give the next steps to implement

give the folder structure

si this anoher file scenario input.jsx

Uncaught ReferenceError: handleSmartSuggest is not defined

how should i do this i also want backend

i am goin to use groq api

https://console.groq.com/home this is the url of the site is it important to changein code

where shoudl this file be placedd?

how to check usjng postman

should api key be placed inside inverted comma

yes it worked

now where should i make changes and what are the chnges to be made

i doint hav eprogressive criteria form

what is progressive reveal

in nthe out it generates 6 output instead of the vlaue i agve as input

AI failed. Please enter manually.

no error in backend

no data got printed

where to put this

give full corrected code

{ "error": "Invalid criteria count" }postman show this error

yeah now it worked in postman

yeah rthis was tehissue

i want to increase the size fo this box hoizontally without increasing the padding

the contents of placeholder is not visible fully

is there any way to make the placeholder to be iun 2 lines

textarea not wo5rrkign

hwo to make text bolder using tailwind

so i found a bug in my code where when click rthe maula generate button options ans d score are rendering but when auto generated these are not coming

als oin both i want the options to come first and only then the scoere matrix

where to paste this

is this okay

so waht is the next step

this happended when i clicked the auto generte

but auto generte buton has nothig to do with options right it generates criterias now criteras not comign

ys now it worked

the problem nwo i have is that now when clikcing auto generate the options and rank matrix are not coming



which normalzation technique is used now?

how to improve and solve problem faced .(context:the problem faced was that the result was negative when actual ranges of values were given,initially the evaluate decision function was designed to work with all the criteria values ranging from 1 to 10)


give difficult test cases to challenge the decision companion system(chatgpt prompt)

i want the weights to be within a limit help me implement it

but after typing 1 i cant change it to any other value by typing

can i make it to show placeholder instead of any other val at first

give ideas to change the background of the app

change the background like that of google antigravity

### Claude Search  
i have implemented most of the features in this and want to add some more things. can you suggest me somthing to add  

i would like to implement this
  
the weights are given between 1 to 10  so should that also be reflected in sandbox  

the commit changes button should save the values in result also right?  

this is my evalute decision function but i would like to use vector normalization plus topsis for this
  
the up and down arrow of the score matrix is not going above and 10 and below 1. i have set the arrows to work that way for the weights but not for the criteria values  

i dont want the min to be 1 and max to be 10 . i want it be the users choice  

use tailwind classname in this file also i the weights are between 1 and 10 but the progress bar is not reacting accordingly
  
give a small description about vector normalization plus topsis to add in my build process file
